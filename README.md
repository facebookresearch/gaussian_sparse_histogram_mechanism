# Gaussian Sparse Histogram Mechanism
It solves the need for Machine Learning developers to know how to set up their development environment and which dependencies to install in order to build mobile app demoes of their models. 

## Requirements
The implementation of the Gaussian Sparse Histogram Mechanism requires `R`.

## How it works
Function `gshm_delta()` implements the Gaussian Sparse Histogram mechanism, taking arguments `c_u`, `sigma`, `tau_diff`, and `epsilon` returning the resulting value of Î´. The `gshm_delta()` function is contained in the file `GSHM_Figures.R`. Execute `GSHM_Figures.R` in `R` to generate the figures appearing in the "Exact Privacy Analysis of the Gaussian Sparse Histogram Mechanism" paper.
